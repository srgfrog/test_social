# A exercise writing a quick social media web site

Technologies
Erlang - easy to create dynamic clusters of servers, with messaging, and
monitoring of processes making messaging with multiple logins by the same 
user account easy, Also running on the erlang nodes:
Cowboy web server - excellent support for websockets and asynchronous messaging

Front end
Elm - because I like it's compiler, the way the compiled code doesn't crash,
good for writing single page applications, and functional programming style.

No database at the moment - just seeing who is online and messaging. No long term storage.
